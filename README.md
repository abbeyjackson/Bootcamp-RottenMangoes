LighthouseLabs.ca iOS Bootcamp assignment - Day 18-20: Information about, and theatres playing, the top 50 movies

App uses Rotten Tomatoes API to pull top 50 movies. Tapping a movie icon takes the user to a detail information page where the name, synopsis, release date, and three reviews are displayed. From the detail view the user can tap a "Show Theatre Map" button. This button pulls theatre information from Google via a Lighthouse API and displays theatres on a map which are currently playing the movie.
